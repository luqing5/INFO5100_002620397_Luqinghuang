                                                     Outline1. Setting Up the Project:*	Initialize a JavaFX project.*	Include necessary dependencies for TensorFlow integration.2. GUI Development:*	Create a JavaFX UI with a canvas for drawing numbers (0-9).*	Implement buttons for functionalities like clearing the canvas, recognizing the drawn number, etc.*	Define event handlers for user interactions.3. TensorFlow Integration:*	Download and integrate TensorFlow libraries into the Java project.*	Load a pre-trained model or train a new model using TensorFlow for number recognition.*	Implement methods to preprocess and format drawn images for TensorFlow input.4. Training TensorFlow Model (python):*	Prepare a dataset of numbers (0-9) in various languages or scripts.*	Train a TensorFlow model using this dataset for recognition.5. Exception Handling:*	Implement try-catch blocks to handle exceptions related to TensorFlow initialization, model loading, or user input errors.*	Display appropriate error messages to the user in case of failures.6. Testing:*	Perform various tests on the application:*	Test drawing numbers on the canvas.*	Test recognition functionality using TensorFlow.7. Difficult:*	Installed TensorFlow does not run properly.*	Recognized numbers always show an error.
